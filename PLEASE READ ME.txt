Steps to run locally:

The first three steps is to build the app

1. go to root directory
2. run "docker-compose up -d --build"
3. run "docker-compose exec php-apache /bin/bash"

Step 3 will enter you in the Laravel environment

4. while in the laravel environment make sure the migrations are run "php artisan migrate"
5. please run database seeder "php artisan db:seed"

Steps 5 and 6 is to start the React application

5. run "cd react"
6. run "yarn start"

After these steps you may visit http://localhost:3000 to see the Dotty MP3 store application

Upon visiting the site, it will ask you to login via Google. I used google social login to simplify the registration process.
